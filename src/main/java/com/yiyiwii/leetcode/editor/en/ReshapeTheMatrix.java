//In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape
// a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.
// 
//
// 
//You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive
// integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted re
//shaped matrix, respectively. 
//
// The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original m
//atrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.
// 
//
// 
//If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output
// the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.
// 
//
// Example 1: 
// 
//Input: 
//nums = 
//[[1,2],
// [3,4]]
//r = 1, c = 4
//Output: 
//[[1,2,3,4]]
//Explanation: The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix 
//is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.
// 
// 
//
// Example 2: 
// 
//Input: 
//nums = 
//[[1,2],
// [3,4]]
//r = 2, c = 4
//Output: 
//[[1,2],
// [3,4]]
//Explanation: There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So o
//utput the original matrix.
// 
// 
//
// Note: 
// 
// The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100]. 
// The given r and c are all positive.
