//Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characte
//rs. 
//
// Example 1:
// 
//Input:
//"tree"
//
//Output:
//"eert"
//
//Explanation:
//'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
//So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid a
//nswer.
// 
// 
//
// Example 2:
// 
//Input:
//"cccaaa"
//
//Output:
//"cccaaa"
//
//Explanation:
//Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
//Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
// 
// 
//
// Example 3:
// 
//Input:
//"Aabb"
//
//Output:
//"bbAa"
//
//Explanation:
//"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
//Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
