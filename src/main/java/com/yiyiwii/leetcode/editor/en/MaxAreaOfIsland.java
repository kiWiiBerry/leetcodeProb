//Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's (r
//epresenting land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may as
//sume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water. 
//
// Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no isl
//and, the maximum area is 0.) 
//
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//[[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
// [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
// [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
// [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
// [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
// [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
// [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
// [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
// 
//Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, because the island 
//must be connected 4-directionally.
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]] 
//Given the above grid, return 0.
//
// Note: The length of each dimension in the given grid does not exceed 50.
