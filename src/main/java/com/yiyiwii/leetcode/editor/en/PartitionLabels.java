//A string S of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this st
//ring into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one p
//art, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts. 
//
// 
//
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
//Output: [9,7,8]
//Explanation:
//The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
//This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
//A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it split
//s S into less parts.
// 
//
// 
//
// Note: 
//
// 
// S will have length in range [1, 500]. 
// S will consist of lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z') only. 
//
