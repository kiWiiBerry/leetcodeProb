//Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions su
//rrounded by 'X'. 
//
// A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region
//. 
//
// Example: 
//
// 
//X X X X
//X O O X
//X X O X
//X O X X
// 
//
// After running your function, the board should be: 
//
// 
//X X X X
//X X X X
//X X X X
//X O X X
// 
//
// Explanation: 
//
// Surrounded regions shouldn‚Äôt be on the border, which means that any 'O' on th
//e border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border 
//and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cell
//s are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
