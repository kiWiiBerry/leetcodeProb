//You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each hous
//e has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged i
//n a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhil
//e, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically c
//ontact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night. 
//
// Given a list of non-negative integers nums representing the amount of money o
//f each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without ale
//rting the police. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: nums = [2,3,2]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 
//2), because they are adjacent houses.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
//Output: 4
//Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
//Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
// 
//
// Example 3: 
//
// 
//Input: nums = [0]
//Output: 0
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// 1 <= nums.length <= 100 
// 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
