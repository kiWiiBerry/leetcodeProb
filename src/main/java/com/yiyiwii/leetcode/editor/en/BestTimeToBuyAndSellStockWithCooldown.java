//Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock 
//on day i. 
//
// Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many tran
//sactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times
//) with the following restrictions: 
//
// 
// You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must se
//ll the stock before you buy again). 
// After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 
//day) 
// 
//
// Example: 
//
// 
//Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
//Output: 3 
//Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
