//
//Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first elem
//ent of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Gre
//ater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order ne
//xt in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greate
//r number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.
// 
//
// Example 1: 
// 
//Input: [1,2,1]
//Output: [2,-1,2]
//Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; The number 2 can't find n
//ext greater number; The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularl
//y, which is also 2.
// 
// 
//
// Note:
//The length of given array won't exceed 10000.
